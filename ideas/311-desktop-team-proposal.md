# Status Desktop proposal

## Summary

Status Desktop is responsible for **TBD**

- react-native-desktop (are we maintaining on a level just enough to run Status Desktop or maintain and evolve this as a separate open source project) ?
- Status desktop releases on all platforms ?

## Budget

Headcount-based. 2 people.

**TBD**

From core team proposal:
>The swarm also has a discretionary budget for bounty based development using Gitcoin, in order to parallelize development.

>Assuming average organizational compensation, this would be roughly 69k/m. Possibly more based on performance, etc.
A self-imposed ceiling of 100k is proposed for budget bucketing (~10%) for the team as a whole.

>Related adjacent activities such as security, devops, marketing, QA, etc will be assumed to be provided and funded by the Gmbh until further notice.


## Core participants

- Max Risuhin
- Volodymyr Kozieiev
- Chad (PM) **TBD**

## Scope

## Process (aka How We Work?)

**TBD**

### Projects

#### react-native-desktop
**TBD**

#### Status desktop
**TBD**


From core team proposal:
>Each project that is currently active should have an umbrella issue that should
link all the other issues. It contains a full description of the project and is
closed when the project is considered "done".

>Some high-level discussions might also happen there.

>This issue should contain all the other issues grouped into areas if necessary.

>Each project should contain **Vision**, **Scope** and **Tradeoffs**.
1. Vision: a high-level goal of the project or a problem we are trying to solve.
2. Scope: limiting conditions that we empose on ourselves when implementing the project (what it is doing and what it is NOT doing).
3. Tradeoffs: a lot of projects can contain tradeoffs that make is feasible to implement. These should be documented there.

>See https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6757 as an example of a similar issue.

>The projects list should have links to umbrella issues for each projects.
